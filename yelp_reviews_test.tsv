Nice ambiance.	1
My girlfriend's veal was very bad.	0
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.	1
Just had lunch here and had a great experience.	1
Reasonably priced also!	1
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.	1
I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.	1

Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.	1
I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.	1
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.	1
Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.	1
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.	0
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.	0
A great touch.	1
They were excellent.	1
Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.	1

I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.	0
Everything was gross.	0
Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.	0
The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.	1
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.	0
We enjoy their pizza and brunch.	1
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.	0
Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.	1
Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.	0
The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.	1
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.	0
Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.	1
What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.	0

The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.	0
A fantastic neighborhood gem !!!	1
And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).	1
I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.	1
Very good, though!	1
The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.	1
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.	0
All in all, I can assure you I'll be back.	1
Waitress was good though!	1
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.	0

This place has it!	1
The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.	1
This place is disgusting!	0

They know how to make them here.	1
There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.	1

I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.	0
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.	1
The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.	1
One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.	1
not even a hello, we will be right with you.	0
The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.	1
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.	0
These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.	1
Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.	1

There is nothing authentic about this place.	0
It was absolutely amazing.	1
I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.	0
